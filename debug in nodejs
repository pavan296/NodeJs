Basic commands:
node debug filename
"cont" is continue 
"restart" = get back to debug sessison
sb(2) = set breakpoint on line 2 then "cont" to start inspecting at 2nd line

above steps halt the execution at 2nd line for example then you need to see values for all arguments then
"repl"

Another point instead of putting "sb" everywhere put "watch" on particular arguments
to cont see every iteration : "cont" should use after "watch"


Recent Changes in Node debugging:
node --inspect --debug-brk fileName
